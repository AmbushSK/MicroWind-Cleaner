# MicroWind-Cleaner
MicroWind Cleaner is a lightweight, high-performance system utility designed to reclaim disk space by safely removing temporary files and redundant system clutter.

Most operating systems accumulate "digital dust" over time—temp folders, cache files, and log data—that can slow down performance and occupy gigabytes of storage. MicroWind Cleaner automates the cleanup process with a single click.

Key Features
Temp File Purge: Cleans the user-level and system-level Temp directories.

Prefetch & Cache: Clears outdated prefetch data and application caches.

Recycle Bin Integration: (Optional feature) Safely empties the bin to recover space immediately.

Minimalist Design: No bloatware, no background processes—just clean and go.

How it Works
MicroWind Cleaner targets specific directories known for accumulating non-essential data:

Scans designated temporary storage paths.

Filters out files currently in use by the system to prevent crashes.

Permanently deletes redundant files to free up disk sectors.
